skymax
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was forked from manio/skymax-demo on git since it allows me to query my
own EASunPower solar inverter.  Apparently, from what I gather on internet forums, a
company in Taiwan called Voltronic Power sells a hardware platform used in many
different brands of inverter.  And my brand just happens to be one of those Voltronic
clones so all the same commands apply.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compilation / running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample build/compilation procedure:
$ git clone https://github.com/nrm21/skymax-demo
$ cd skymax-demo
$ mkdir out
$ cd out
$ cmake ..
$ make

Then you need to get the real hidraw device name (probably hidraw0):
$ dmesg | grep hidraw

and then run the program like this (assuming it is located in '/opt/skymax/out' dir):
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -d /dev/hidraw0 -i 15

The program will run once, it will spit out values it receives from the inverter in
JSON format and exits.  It was intended to be run by telegraf using the exec plugin
every 15 seconds, and that output data will be imported into an InfluxDB instance
where it can be easily graphed by grafana (or some other "TIG or TICK stack"-like
software suite).

The program can also be made to send raw commands to the inverter if you choose:
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -d /dev/hidraw0 -r POP00 (set utility output mode)
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -d /dev/hidraw0 -r POP02 (set SBU output mode)
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -d /dev/hidraw0 -r PCP00 (set utility charging mode)
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -d /dev/hidraw0 -r PCP03 (set solar only charging mode)
etc...
